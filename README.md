# Elapse
Elapse is an interactive time visualization webapp that allows busy people to rationalize their busy lives.

## How to use Elapse
Hopefully, we will soon have a link for you to click to use our app, but it's not here yet...

## Dependencies
Elapse uses the following packages:
- [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org)
- [icalendar](https://github.com/collective/icalendar) 
- [vincent](https://github.com/wrobstory/vincent)

<!-- ## SOME COOL PHOTOS
Coming soon... -->

## Implementation
Elapse was developed using Python.  We used the [icalendar](https://github.com/collective/icalendar) package to parse iCal data, and [vincent](https://github.com/wrobstory/vincent) to implement our data visualizations.

## Contributors
Elapse was created by [Gaby Clarke](https://github.com/gabyclarke) and [Alexander Hoppe](https://github.com/aehoppe) for our Software Design course at [Olin College of Engineering](http://www.olin.edu).
