# TR1 Reflection
**Gaby Clarke and Alex Hoppe**

## Process reflection
- Getting people onto the boards and out of their seats was really helpful for ideation
- We weren’t sure how formal this was supposed to be, and we didn’t plan for our presentation to be super formal, which ended up working out decently well
- We addressed everything we wanted to address
- Good time management
- Documentation of ideation session was good

## Feedback and decisions
Feedback
- Project seems well scoped
- Good instructor feedback
  - Stick with native local data storage format unless we need extra features
- Privacy concerns not really an issue if this is a client-side app
  - Contact club leaders/public officers for data
- Feature ideas:
  - Comparing time allotted vs. time you actually spend
- Interesting visualization ideas:
  - Relations between events
  - Playing with timeline flow
  - Scrolling time
  - Word clusters
  - Hourglass / sands of time
The Plan:
- Finish data structures
- Get a basic visual something together before our next meeting
