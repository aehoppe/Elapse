Looking back on this project, I have some conflicted feelings.

When choosing a project, I knew that I wanted to learn more about web development.  I still do, and am excited to take olin.js in the near future.  However, I feel like Alex and I spent way more time on the web integration than we wanted to or had initially intended to, as we ran into a lot of problems and spent a fair bit of time trying to understand the language of our problems so we could solve them.  As a result of this, we got to have less fun with our visualizations, which was something I was personally excited about.  I think it's really interesting to try to visualize time because it is in many ways very abstract and subjective.

Throughout this project (and the course in general), I have definitely improved my debugging skills.  This was one of my learning goals for the course, as I really struggled with it in ModSim, and was just starting to get a grasp on it in POE last semester.

So, things didn't go quite as we expected, but they turned out alright.
